> _Exemplary observations utilized in our multi-modal bi-temporal change detection work. Left: Rows of optical Sentinel-2 data as well as co-registered radar Sentinel-1 data. Each column denotes a different time point, pre- and post change. Right: The associated change map. The Sentinel-2 observations and pixel-wise annotations are by Daudt et al (2018), we curated and provide additional Sentinel-1 SAR data._

whose original data set we built upon and extended. The original Sentinel-2 observations and pixel-wise annotations are available [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/oscd-onera-satellite-change-detection). We curated and provide additional Sentinel-1 SAR measurements, co-registered and temporally aligned with the original data in order to provide an opportunity for multi-sensor change detection.
